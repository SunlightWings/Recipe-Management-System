## About The Project

![GIF_FILE_DEMO_APP](https://github.com/Sudeep-K/RecipeManagementSystem/blob/main/projectrecipe.gif)

This project was done by a group of four in the freshmen year on C, as an introduction to working in a team, to produce some result, however small they might be. 

The goal of this Project was to answer the following questions:

- How to view desired recipe according to different categories?
- How to enable the users to add their own cuisines in the program and save other cuisines for further use?
- How do we collaborate as a group of four members on the same software? How do we select which features to implement, and which to skip, with regrads to the time constraint set on the project?
